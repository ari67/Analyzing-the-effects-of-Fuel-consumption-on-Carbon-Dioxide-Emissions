# Analyzing-the-effects-of-Fuel-consumption-on-Carbon-Dioxide-Emissions
Climate change has been one of the most severe issues nowadays. The overuse of greenhouse gases hurts us, leading to things such as contributing to respiratory disease, extreme weather, and food supply disruptions. Here the objective is to analyze the relationship between fuel consumption and carbon emissions to emphasize on the importance of factors that affect climate change. Here, we find the effect of model-specific fuel consumption ratings on estimated carbon dioxide emissions for new light-duty vehicles for retail sale in Canada. For that we consider the fuel consumption ratings(L/100km) as the independent variable(x) and carbon dioxide emissions(g/km) as the dependent variable(y). Here, I Conducted data-driven investigation into the relationship between fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emissions, addressing the critical issue of climate change. Also I developed a robust Linear Regression model that demonstrated a positive correlation between fuel consumption ratings and carbon dioxide emissions.
